## User Story

```
I WANT to display to my potential employers my deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can showcase samples of my work and assess because I am a good candidate for their open positions
```


## My work 

```
I have presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN they click on the images of the applications
THEN they taken to that deployed application
WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
